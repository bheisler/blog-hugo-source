Hello! I'm Brook Heisler. I'm a software developer from Saskatoon. When I'm not
busy programming, I spend my time propmaking instead. This is reflected in the
dual nature of this blog, which is mostly about my hobby projects. Here, you'll
find detailed build logs about my prop projects and even-more-detailed
information on my code projects, as well as whatever else I feel like writing
about. If you're only interested in one of those two things, that's cool - use
the category links above to focus on only code or only props. There are even
separate RSS feeds. Cheers!
