I started working on this last fall, but didn't have time to do much before
winter set in. RWBY is what originally got me into propmaking, so it's good to
get back to it. I've already made Yang's Ember Celica shotgauntlets and Adam's
#TODO: insert pics
Wilt & Blush Sword/Shotgun Combo. This time around, I'm going to be building one
of Penny's swords, which unfortunately don't have a cool name yet. This is the
first time I'm documenting my process, and I'm going to be experimenting with
a bunch of new tools and techniques this time (including electronics to make
it light up).

## Blueprints & Design

#TODO: Include something about the actual blueprints, maybe?

First, a quick overview of how I intend to build this. Hopefully at least some
parts of this plan will survive contact with reality. The plan is to make the
blade out of two pieces of 1/2 inch MDF laminated together around a steel rod.
The rod is mostly to have a secure place to attach the hilt and guard. The
light-up detail along the blade will be done with EL wire or LEDs covered by a
thin layer of scratched-up acrylic glass to diffuse the light. The other details
on the blade will mostly be made of wood, MDF and styrene. I'm not entirely sure
how I'm going to cut or sand the bevel for the edge of the blade, going to figure
that out when I get there. The guard is a more complex shape than it appears. It
isn't just a disk - the center is dished in a bit. I also need it to be hollow,
since that's where I'll put the batteries and electronics to make it light up.
Turning it on a lathe would be ideal, but I don't have a lathe or any idea how
to use one. I'll probably end up having to CNC that. The hilt will also be a
challenge - it's oval shaped, not round. I'm going to try to cut it out of a
wooden dowel with a spokeshave and make the extra details out of styrene. If
that doesn't work, I'll probably end up 3D printing, molding and casting it
instead.

## Blade

This is the part I did last fall. I took a big block of 1/2 inch MDF to my [local
makerspace](http://sktechworks.ca/) and put it on the CNC mill. I came up with
some plan to use the manual control mode of the mill to cut the block into two
halves of the blade, which I would then glue together. I milled a 1/4 inch round
groove down the center of the inside of the blade to hold a steel rod for
reinforcement. Then I flipped each piece over and milled a second groove on the
outside of the blade for the light-up section. Unfortunately, I've completely
forgotten the exact process I used to do this so I can't give more details.

Fast forward six months or so and it's time to glue this thing together. I
scuffed up the in-sides of the blade parts and the steel rod with sandpaper so
the glue would hold better and then covered it in wood glue and epoxy and clamped
the pieces together. This turned out to be a mistake. In my haste to get
everything together before the epoxy started to set, I didn't line up the two
parts properly. They're not even close.

D'oh. Shortly afterwards I also realized that the grooves I'd cut to hold the
acrylic light diffuser and EL wire are only 2-3mm deep - much too shallow to
contain both the 2mm acrylic sheet and the 2.6mm EL wire. Double D'oh. I decided
to attempt to repair the damage rather than just starting over. There's so much
to learn fixing mistakes, I thought, and anyway, if I really messed it up I
could still throw it out and start over.
