I started working on this last fall, but didn't have time to do much before
winter set in. RWBY is what originally got me into propmaking, so it's good to
get back to it. I've already made Yang's Ember Celica shotgauntlets and Adam's
Wilt & Blush Sword/Shotgun Combo. This time around, I'm going to be building one
of Penny's swords, which unfortunately don't have a cool name yet. This is the
first time I'm documenting my process, and I'm going to be experimenting with
a bunch of new tools and techniques this time (including electronics to make
it light up).

## Blueprints & Design

First, a quick overview of how I intend to build this. Hopefully at least some
parts of this plan will survive contact with reality. The plan is to make the
blade out of two pieces of 1/2 inch MDF laminated together around a steel rod.
The rod is mostly to have a secure place to attach the hilt and guard. The
light-up detail along the blade will be done with EL wire or LEDs covered by a
thin layer of scratched-up acrylic glass to diffuse the light. The other details
on the blade will mostly be made of wood, MDF and styrene. I'm not entirely sure
how I'm going to cut or sand the bevel for the edge of the blade, going to figure
that out when I get there. The guard is a more complex shape than it appears. It
isn't just a disk - the center is dished in a bit. I also need it to be hollow,
since that's where I'll put the batteries and electronics to make it light up.
Turning it on a lathe would be ideal, but I don't have a lathe or any idea how
to use one. I'll probably end up having to CNC that. The hilt will also be a
challenge - it's oval shaped, not round. I'm going to try to cut it out of a
wooden dowel with a spokeshave and make the extra details out of styrene. If
that doesn't work, I'll probably end up 3D printing, molding and casting it
instead.

As usual, I started by finding reference material and tracing out some blueprints
in Inkscape. Reference material for RWBY is usually pretty easy to find, since
Rooster Teeth often releases detailed turnaround shots of the characters and
their gear for exactly this purpose.

## Blade

This is the part I did last fall. I took a big block of 1/2 inch MDF to my [local
makerspace](http://sktechworks.ca/) and put it on the CNC mill. I came up with
some plan to use the manual control mode of the mill to cut the block into two
halves of the blade, which I would then glue together. I milled a 1/4 inch round
groove down the center of the inside of the blade to hold a steel rod for
reinforcement. Then I flipped each piece over and milled a second groove on the
outside of the blade for the light-up section. Unfortunately, I've completely
forgotten the exact process I used to do this so I can't give more details.

Fast forward six months or so and it's time to glue this thing together. I
scuffed up the in-sides of the blade parts and the steel rod with sandpaper so
the glue would hold better and then covered it in wood glue and epoxy and clamped
the pieces together. This turned out to be a mistake. In my haste to get
everything together before the epoxy started to set, I didn't line up the two
parts properly. They're not even close.

{{< figure src="/static/pennys-sword-shame.jpg" caption="Those lines should line up." >}}

D'oh. Shortly afterwards I also realized that the grooves I'd cut to hold the
acrylic light diffuser and EL wire are only 2-3mm deep - much too shallow to
contain both the 2mm acrylic sheet and the 2.6mm EL wire. Double D'oh. I decided
to attempt to repair the damage rather than just starting over. There's so much
to learn fixing mistakes, I thought, and anyway, if I really messed it up I
could still throw it out and start over.

I was able to deepen the groove for the light diffuser by placing a wide chisel
along the sides of the groove and tapping it lightly to cut the fibers and allow
the bits of MDF to come free without tearout. I then used a quarter-inch chisel
along the bottom of the groove to cut the bottom a bit deeper. I then proceeded
to cut another section out of the center of the groove using a ball-end bit on
my rotary tool for the EL wire to run along. That worked... less well, since it's
nigh-impossible to cut a straight line when the tool itself is pulling to one
side erratically. Fortunately, that part shouldn't be easily visible so it's OK.
I also used some Bondo to fill in the ends of the grooves so that they lined up
with each other.

I cut as much of the edge bevel on my scrollsaw as I could. Unfortunately, the
sword is too long to fit entirely on the saw, and the saw can't cut at the right
angles for much of the blade. If you look carefully, you'll notice that the
angle of the edge bevels isn't constant along the blade, and I can't do that on
my saw. In the end, I ended up cutting most of the edge bevel with a couple of
hand files and a rasp. That actually worked quite well. It took several hours and
a lot of elbow grease, but there's something satisfying about patiently working
with hand tools until something is just right. If you plan to do this at home,
be sure you know how about Draw Filing. If you don't, the idea is that you hold
one end of the file in each hand, press the center against the work and push
it forward and draw it back. I've found this technique to be much faster and
more controllable than filing along the length of the file using a sawing motion.

{{< figure src="/static/pennys-sword-half-blade.jpg" >}}

Once that was done, I spread some Bondo on some of the areas where I'd filed too
far and sealed the MDF with cyanoacrylate. I generally recommend thin CA for this,
as it soaks deeper into the MDF, but my bottle of thin CA is so old that it's
turned into thick CA all on its own. Have to get some more of that. Regardless
of the viscosity though, when the CA hardens you're left with a rough but hard
and nicely sandable surface which won't soak up paint the way unsealed MDF does.
I suspect it would even be wet-sandable, but I've never tried that myself.

With that, plus some more sanding and spot-putty work, the blade is ready for
primer.

## Blade Details

To make the round decoration along the spine of the blade, I cut a piece of 1/2
inch dowel down the middle very carefully on my scroll saw, then cleaned it up
by rubbing the flat side of the now-half-round dowel along a file. I glued that
down as straight as I could manage and cleaned up the seam as best I could with
filler primer, files and sanding twigs. For the larger half-cylindro-spherical
(yeah, I had to look that up) bit at the end, I cut a piece of 3/4 inch dowel
in half and cleaned it up as before, then used a sanding drum on my ancient
rotary tool to sculpt the half-sphere part. This actually worked remarkably
well. I couldn't get it to be quite round enough with just the rotary tool, but
some work with a sanding sponge and filler primer got it close enough. The inner
corners between the two parts and the spine of the blade are hard to reach so
they're not as clean as I'd like, but they're probably good enough.

There are some additional details on either side of the blade, but those will
have to wait. Those details are on top of the lens for the glowy sections on
the side, which poses an order-of-operations problem. I have to install the EL
wire and the lens before I can add those details, and then I have to paint those
detail bits and the rest of the blade after the lens is installed. So I'll have
to mask out the lens and try not to get any paint on it. That's going to be fun.

There is also an oblong piece on either side of the blade where it meets the
guard. I intially tried cutting these out on my scroll saw and sanding them to
the right shape, but I couldn't quite get it right so I ended up just
laser-cutting them at the makerspace instead.

## Guard

Oh boy. This thing gave me so much trouble. As I mentioned above, I don't have
a lathe and wouldn't know how to use one if I did. That means I really have two
options for making this piece. I could cut it on the CNC mill, or I could 3D
print it. I don't really like either one (as a computer programmer by day, both
of these options are too much like my real job) but needs must. I haven't had
much experience on the CNC mill at my local makerspace, and I'm proud to say
that I've added a number of shining new mistakes to that experience which I
hope to not repeat.

Because this part needs to be cut on both sides, I needed to be able to flip
over the work piece without actually moving it relative to the bed of the CNC
machine. In my case, this means drilling a couple of holes through the material
into the sacrificial board on the bed of the machine, into which I can place
pieces of dowel. In theory, I could then flip the material over, make sure the
dowels are seated in their holes in the sacrificial board, and then carry on
cutting on the other side. In practice, the fact that I had to use standard
drill bits combined with the much higher RPMs of the router meant that this
operation caused nasty tearout. I could probably have solved this by adding
another piece of sacrificial material on top of the workpiece.

This CNC machine doesn't have a tool-changer, so I had to manually replace the
tool multiple times during the cut. That wouldn't be so much of a problem
except it's easy to accidentally reset the zero for the wrong axis part way
through the process, rendering it impossible to finish. Which is what I did the
first time I tried cutting the guard. The second time, my work piece came loose
and I was informed that I had the movement speed of the CNC router set far too
high. Since this CNC machine is someone's home-brew DIY project, it's somewhat
lacking in documentation. Fortunately nothing was damaged except my MDF.

This is about when I decided that maybe it'd be easier to just print it instead.
This actually worked, which is nice. It took a lot of sanding, puttying, priming
and repeating before it looked smooth enough, but I did get there in the end. It
even printed in the 1/4 inch holes on either end to attach it to the rod inside
the blade, though I did have to use a 1/4 inch rat tail file to open them up a
bit.

The guard also has some other parts. First, some flat segments to turn the ring
into a complete guard, which I laser-cut from acrylic and then finessed a bit
with my files until they fit into the ring. Second, there are some sections
that are raise above the center of the guard and have a power-symbol design that
lights up. Those were also laser-cut from MDF and acrylic. All of these small
MDF pieces were filleted with a sanding sponge, sealed with CA and primed.

## Hilt

Compared to all of this, the hilt was actually quite easy. I cut a couple of
sections of dowel to about twice the necessary length and took them to the
makerspace. After some failed experiments with the drill press, I asked a couple
of the guys there to help me with using the lathe to drill along the center of
the dowel. I'll be honest - they did the work for me (thanks Al and Scott!).
Then I just cut the oversized dowel in half and had two hilt-sized bits of wood
which fit nicely on the 1/4 inch rod extending from the blade. One real one and
a backup in case I messed up the first one. Helpful tip - always make spares.
More often than not, you'll end up needing them.

I'd originally planned to try to use a spokeshave to cut the round dowel, but
the spokeshave was too dull to cut with when it arrived. Learning how to
sharpen blades is another one of those skills I really ought to learn sometime.
For now, though, I just clamped the dowel down in my vice and went at it with
my files and a sanding sponge. I've yet to find a more versatile tool than my
cheap set of hand files from Home Depot.

The hilt has a raised section on either end. Initially, I thought I'd heat up
some 1mm styrene, wrap it around and glue it in place. This didn't work
(probably because I was trying to use a hair dryer and hot water. Maybe a heat
gun would have worked). After puzzling about it for a while, I came up with a
better idea. I cut a strip of thinner styrene which was flexible on its own.
Then I wrapped that around the hilt multiple times, using styrene cement to
glue each layer to the one beneath it like a roll of tape. This left an edge
where the styrene strip ended, but some filing and sanding blended that in
nicely. The styrene cement bonded the styrene to itself but not to the wood, so
I mixed a bit of epoxy and glued the two styrene end-caps to the dowel.

This all worked pretty well, but the two end-caps weren't quite flush with the
sides of the hilt. I fixed that by scooping some baking soda into the gaps,
tapping it a bit to get it inside, and then scraping away the excess. With the
baking soda filling the gap, I dripped some thin CA (by this point I'd bought
a new bottle) inside. Baking soda causes CA to harden instantly and take up
more space than CA normally does, so this filled in the gaps nicely. A bit more
work with some needle files and sanding twigs to clean up the excess and it was
ready to go.
